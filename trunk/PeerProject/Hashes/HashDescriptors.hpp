		//! Sometimes it is necessary to access the hash as a bytestream and
		//! bypass alignment and padding restrictions mposed by the Word type.
		//! This POD structure contains an array of appropriate size
		//! and subscripting operators for convenience.
		//! \brief Defines urn signatures.
		//!
		//! This structure contains definitions for a particular urn and hash.
		//! Used to define models of \ref hashdescriptorpage "Hash Descriptor".
		//! The scheme used for a urn here is simple:
		//! - A urn consists of a prefix which identifies the urn.
		//! 	This prefix orms the first part of the urn string.
		//! - The second part of the string consists of arbitrary data,
		//! 	at a fixed position of that part a hash string can be found.
		//! Members of a UrnString structure define these properties for a given urn prefix.

			//! \brief The minimum urn string length.
			//! This specifies the minimum length a given string must have in order
			//! to be valid for that string type. There must be enough space for the
			//! prefix itself and the hash string at least; possibly more if the urn
			//! specifies additional data we don't care about here.

		//! unless there is only one block. In the latter case Ed2k and MD4 are
		//! identical. Since the Edonkey network does not support files larger than
		//! 4GB this hash type shall not be used to identify such files.

		//! The Bittorrent info hash is a compound hash based on SHA1.

		//! from which the SHA1 is taken. The info hash is then computed as the SHA1 of
		//! all individual SHA1 digests. Exact block length may vary from torrent to torrent.
		//! Although this info hash has the same properties as a SHA1 hash
		//! it does not have the same semantics and comparing or assigning between
		//! info hashes and plain SHA1 is not meaningful. In this template system,
		//! both are distinct types, thus such meaningless operations cannot take place.
