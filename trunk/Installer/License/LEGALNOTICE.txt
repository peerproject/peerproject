This is a lay summary to assist in reading the licensing in full.


You are not required to agree with the applicable licenses, however
they are the only means allowing you to use this copyrighted material.

No terms abridge fair-use rights or redistribution as-is free of charge.

If you do not accept all terms, you may not reuse PeerProject in any way.




______________________________________________________________________


The spirit of open-source is encouraged, and the primary intent is compliance.
However, perceived abuses will be vigorously pursued.



COMMERICIAL/RE-USE REMINDERS:

While the GPL allows for commercial use, CC-BY-NC-SA clearly does not.
Therefore no original artwork may be used in any commercial applications of this source.

Furthermore, all (extended) conditions of the GPL v3 License must be met.



Conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate PeerProject copyright notice.

Carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License (GPL 3.0).

You must license entire new work, as a whole, under this License (GPL 3.0 or later)
to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.

New work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it,
and giving a relevant date (and/or accurate version number).

"You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,"
however you effectively MUST charge nothing if Non-commercial artwork remains included.


Futhermore:

Prohibited misrepresentation of the origin of the material.

Required preservation of legal notices and 'PeerProject' author attribution.

Required modified versions to be marked as to be differentiated from the original source.

Limited use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the material.

Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of trade names and trademarks.

Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently (additionally).

And, Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of this material,
with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient.

(End users and redistributers are liable as to their own conduct,
and for any hardships brought upon the authors by their conduct.)


Lastly, The 'Affero Clause' is in effect:

Any publicly accessible modifications or derivative works require
the modified source must be made publicly available (via webserver) as well.
This includes all instances where 'evidence' thereof is publicly produced.


Questions should be addressed to PeerProject.org prior to making any assumptions.


PeerProject is primarily a general internet client/server ("web browser") with no control over networks.

PeerProject is also wholely dependent upon the contributions of disassociated volunteers worldwide.

Any party with a dispute MUST submit an appropriate bugfix -or technically detailed
and actionable complaint- PRIOR to taking any actions against PeerProject,
technical or otherwise. Due to Open Source, there can be no guarantees of any kind.
