Useful information if you're working on the remote
__________________________________________________

I tried to get as much as possible into external files, 
so loading the remote is quicker as soon as your browser has cached the js and css files. 
This also makes editing the remote itself easier, as you now only have to edit the css file
to change the page style. You should be able to do all your styling needs through css, 
without having to touch the code. same with javascript: the .js is completely independant,
and doesn't rely on functions coded into the html.

If you want to add more external resource files, you *must* put them in the '/images' folder. 
For some reason PeerProject is programmed to only get resources from there, so don't 
create a 'js','script','css' or 'foo' folder because you prefer to have them seperated.

If you feel you hacked this remote into something useful, 
please post your changes somewhere. They might make it into
the next release (if they're really useful and crossbrowser).
